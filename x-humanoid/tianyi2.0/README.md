# Tianyi 2.0 Pro Driver

Phanthy Motus driver bundle for the Tianyi 2.0 Pro humanoid robot. The driver
bridges robot-side ROS2 topics on domain 0 to Agent Core topics on domain 42 and
exposes the capabilities as MCP tools.

## Head gesture card

`head_gesture` turns safe, bounded head-position commands into cancellable
semantic sequences.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Tool name | `head_gesture` |
| Tool type | `actuator` |
| Robot-side output | `/head/cmd_pos` |
| Message type | `bodyctrl_msgs/msg/CmdSetMotorPosition` |
| Actions | `nod`, `shake`, `scan`, `tilt`, `reset`, `stop` |

Yaw, pitch and roll are clamped to the limits already documented by the raw
`head` card. Starting a new gesture cancels the remaining frames of the previous
gesture; `stop` cancels future frames without issuing an additional pose. A nod
moves from neutral to positive pitch (down) and back to neutral; it never passes
through negative pitch (up).

Before publishing, the card checks fresh `/head/status` data, all three head
motors, motor error codes, emergency-stop state and power state. It then waits
up to two seconds for newer status and verifies that the head moved or was
already at the target. A verified call returns `feedback_verified: true`;
failures return `state: error`, a stable diagnostic `code`, details in the MCP
result, and protocol-level `isError: true`.

| Action | Dashboard defaults | Allowed range |
|---|---|---|
| `nod` | cycles 2, amplitude 12°, speed 30°/s | cycles 1–5, amplitude 5–20°, speed 5–60°/s |
| `shake` | cycles 2, amplitude 25°, speed 30°/s | cycles 1–5, amplitude 5–45°, speed 5–60°/s |
| `scan` | cycles 2, amplitude 25°, speed 30°/s, hold 1.0s/side | cycles 1–5, amplitude 5–45°, speed 5–60°/s, hold 0.2–3.0s/side |
| `tilt` | left, amplitude 12°, speed 30°/s, hold 0.8s | side left/right, amplitude 5–20°, speed 5–60°/s, hold 0.2–3.0s |
| `reset` | speed 30°/s | speed 5–60°/s |
| `stop` | no parameters | no parameters |

## Arm gesture card

`arm_gesture` provides semantic arm motions on top of the existing joint-level
`arm` card.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Tool name | `arm_gesture` |
| Tool type | `actuator` |
| Robot-side output | `/arm/cmd_pos` |
| Message type | `bodyctrl_msgs/msg/CmdSetMotorPosition` |
| Actions | `salute`, `welcome`, `raise`, `shake_hands`, `high_five`, `reset`, `stop` |

The right-arm poses are mirrored from the left-arm definitions and remain
inside the checked-in URDF limits. The preset poses still require low-speed,
clear-area calibration on the target robot before production use. Do not run
the raw `arm` card and `arm_gesture` concurrently because both publish to the
same controller topic.

The semantic poses use a preparation frame before the final gesture. For
`welcome`, `salute`, and `high_five`, shoulder roll and shoulder yaw first
establish the elbow-flexion plane; elbow pitch can then raise the forearm
instead of leaving it horizontal in front of the torso. `salute` uses three
blended stages: the preparation frame bends the elbow, the second frame raises
the upper arm laterally and flexes the elbow to approximately 130 degrees to
draw the wrist inward beside the head, then 50 degrees of wrist yaw completes
the final salute. In this URDF chain, shoulder yaw rotates the downstream
elbow-pitch axis: positive left-arm yaw (mirrored negative on the right) makes
negative elbow pitch lift and fold the forearm inward, while the opposite yaw
direction drives the forearm downward. Intermediate stages have no dwell and
hand off at 90% of their calculated transition time to avoid stop-start motion.
The action is intentionally limited to one arm at a time to avoid interference
near the head. The preparation frame bends the elbow before completing the
shoulder rotation, avoiding a fully extended sweep near the head. `welcome`
raises the hand beside and above the torso rather than in front of the chest.
It keeps shoulder yaw and all wrist axes fixed at their selected values, with
all three wrist angles remaining neutral throughout. It sweeps elbow pitch
between -110 and -90 degrees, which the checked-in URDF places mainly along the
lateral axis; changing shoulder yaw here would instead move the hand mainly
forward and backward.
`raise` lifts the upper arm close to overhead while keeping only a moderate
elbow bend, making its silhouette distinct from `welcome`.
`shake_hands` extends one arm with a smaller shoulder-pitch angle than the old
forward-reach pose and uses a small elbow sweep for the handshake.
`high_five` places the wrist approximately 0.37 m in front of the torso plane
and at approximately the shoulder-joint height in the checked-in URDF.

Wrist pitch stays neutral in every semantic frame. The final `salute` frame
moves wrist yaw to 50 degrees to orient the hand. `welcome` keeps all wrist
joints at zero for the entire sequence. For the left-arm `high_five`, wrist
roll moves from 10 degrees in the preparation frame to 30 degrees in the final
frame; the right arm uses the mirrored negative angles.

The URDF defines joint axes and limits but contains no hand palm frame and no
arm visual/collision geometry. Palm-facing wrist values are therefore
conservative starting points, not geometrically proven orientations. Calibrate
`welcome`, `salute`, and `high_five` one arm at a time at low speed
with a clear workspace. Bilateral `salute` and `high_five` are blocked; actions
such as clapping, hugging, and crossing arms are intentionally not provided
until collision geometry or a separate collision checker is available.

Before publishing an action, the card checks fresh `/arm/status` data, all
selected motor IDs, motor error codes, the physical/remote emergency stop and
power state. After publishing, it waits up to two seconds for a newer
`/arm/status` sample and verifies that a selected joint moved (or was already
at the requested target). The MCP result therefore distinguishes a scheduled
action from controller feedback with `feedback_verified: true`. Failures return
`state: error`, a stable `code`, the human-readable `error`, and relevant
diagnostic details.
MCP tool failures are also marked with the protocol-level `isError: true`, so
the dashboard/agent can distinguish them from successful results without
parsing the text payload first.

The SDK does not expose a dedicated "self-check completed" field in the message
types used here. A no-motion result can therefore identify an incomplete
self-check/Not Ready state as a likely cause, but cannot claim it conclusively.
Complete the documented startup self-check and confirm the whole-body status
light indicates Ready before running arm actions.

| Action | Dashboard defaults | Allowed range |
|---|---|---|
| `salute` | right arm, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `welcome` | right arm, cycles 2, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right/both, cycles 1–5, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `raise` | right arm, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right/both, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `shake_hands` | right arm, cycles 2, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right/both, cycles 1–5, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `high_five` | right arm, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `reset` | right arm, speed 0.5rad/s | side left/right/both, speed 0.2–1.5rad/s |
| `stop` | no parameters | no parameters |
